Hello New, this is your first task.
        
I know you think it will be easy but you are wrong.
        
You are very WRONG.
        
It's very easy :)
Enjoy ;>
        
Oh, I almost forget it. it's your time now to solve the TASK:
        
NOTE: Write any commands you use in commands.txt.
        

 - First mission to you is making Directory in 'task_1' folder and name it my_dir.
        
 - Second you must create file in 'my_dir' and name it let say hmmm... your name, right (: .
        
 - Edit it and add something like 'I use Linux because it's better than Windows' or anything else (but I recommend the previous one).
        
 - Then create 2 soft (use absolute and relative path) links and one hard to your file name them anything (don't be silly and name the links 'anything' :| )
        
 - Then make directory name it 'links' (I know I'm very creative) in my_dir and put the links inside it.
        
 - Copy the directory 'links' to your home.
        
 - Now list the files in the links directory which in your home.
        
 - Ok know remember the number of hard links to file 'Your Name' and delete the links directory which in home (ok I know it strange why I'll ask you to copy something and delete it but I'm the TASK remeber?).
        
 - Remove the invalid links (we won't need it).
        
 - Make this directory in one command in task_1 'linux/(enter your linux distro)'.   'Hint: use man or --help'
        
Now good bye ;)
        
Don't forget to write your commands (Pleeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaase add   'cd'   commands if you use relative path).
